## The nth Notation

n is a function of n

> Output is a function of input

Come high level runtimes

|oh year|woofoo|
|test|test|

constant time = (n)

```js
function printFirstItemInArray(someArray) {
    console.log(someArray[0]);
}
```

### Why are we interested in the n-notation?

The n-notation allows us to theoretically analyze how an algorithm will scale based on increasing input.
